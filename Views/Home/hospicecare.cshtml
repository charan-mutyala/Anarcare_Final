        <h3>What’s Covered Under Hospice Care (What Medicare Covers)</h3>

        <p>Before starting hospice care, you are eligible for a consultation with a hospice doctor or the medical director. This discussion is to answer your questions and help you understand your care options.</p>

        <p>We recommend you always ask about the best approach to managing your pain and symptoms under the hospice palliative umbrella—even if you choose not to proceed with hospice care.</p>

        <p>Once hospice begins, Medicare or Medicaid covers all services related to your terminal illness and any associated conditions—as long as care is provided by a Medicare-approved hospice provider.</p>

        <p>Hospice services are typically offered at home but may also be provided at other residences, including inpatient facilities, when needed. Your customized care plan may include:</p>

        <h3>Hospice Care Costs Covered by Medicare (What You Pay for Hospice Care)</h3>
        
        <p>Medicare and Medicaid cover most of your hospice care costs with no deductible. However, you may still have a few small out-of-pocket expenses:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You’ll continue paying your regular Medicare Part A and Part B premiums, which will still cover medical expenses not associated with hospice services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once hospice benefits begin, Original Medicare covers all care related to your terminal illness, including other approved medical needs.</p>
        
        <p>If you require hospital care due to your illness, your hospice provider must arrange it in order for Medicare to cover the costs. If not properly arranged, you may be responsible for the full expense.</p>

                <li>Treatments aimed at curing your illness aren’t included. Hospice care focuses on comfort, not cure.</li>
                <li>Drugs not related to your terminal illness may not be covered under hospice but could be covered by your Medicare Part D plan.</li>
                <li>Care from providers outside your hospice team isn’t covered unless you switch to that provider officially.</li>
                <li>Room and board costs aren’t covered unless you're receiving short-term inpatient or respite care as arranged by your hospice provider.</li>
                <li>Emergency room visits, hospital stays, or ambulance services that are unrelated to your terminal illness won’t be covered unless arranged by your hospice team.</li>
                <li>Any services not arranged via your Hospice team or services received from any provider or organization out-of-Network with your Hospice Provider.</li>

        <h3>Duration of Hospice Care</h3>
        <p>Hospice care is intended for individuals with a life expectancy of six months or less. However, terminal conditions are unpredictable. If you live longer than six months, you may continue receiving hospice care as long as the hospice doctor continues to certify that the terminal illness persists and that continued care is needed.</p>
        
        <p>Hospice care is divided into benefit periods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two initial 90-day periods</li>
            <li>Followed by unlimited 60-day periods</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each period begins on the day hospice care starts based on physician certification and continues until the benefit period ends. After the first 90-day period, your hospice doctor must confirm your eligibility again at the start of each new benefit period.</p>

        <p>You do not need to reapply or reselect hospice services each time—your hospice provider handles that process for you.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Recertification by a physician is required at the end of every benefit period to continue receiving hospice care.</p>

        <h3>Stopping Hospice Care</h3>
        <p>You have the right to stop hospice care at any time—especially if your health improves or your illness goes into remission. If you choose to stop, your hospice provider will ask you to sign a form confirming the end date of care.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only you can make the decision to stop hospice care. Never sign any forms unless you personally requested them.</li>
            <li>If you were on Medicare, you’ll continue with that coverage and can return to hospice care later if needed.</li>
            <li>If you were on a Medicare Advantage Plan, you can stay in the same plan and continue coverage—as long as you keep paying your plan’s premiums.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Always consult with your hospice team before making any decisions.</strong></p>
