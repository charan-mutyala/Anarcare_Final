        <p>
            Volunteers are very important to us. Hospice volunteers provide essential support, including running errands, preparing meals, assistance with home activities, emotional and spiritual support.
            Volunteers are screened and trained to assure a person is right for this work and are given an option of volunteer work.<br /><br />
            5% budget goes to volunteers. Volunteers may choose their own schedule. Retired professionals are welcome.<br /><br />
